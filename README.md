# Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning in an HPC system and deployment to the Cloud

<i>Combining Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning is the most challenging Artificial
Intelligence research and development area at present. Scaling these types of applications in
an HPC infrastructure available in the cloud will be crucial for advancing the massive use
of these technologies. The purpose of this project is to develop and test various implementations of Deep RL algorithms given a selected case study, using Barcelona Supercomputing
Centerâ€™s (BSC) CTE-POWER cluster, and make a deployment to the cloud of the training
pipeline to analyze its costs and viability in a production environment.</i>
